## What is Pulse?

We built Pulse (www.pulsemcp.com) to support adoption of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol). We believe that MCP is the standard upon which an LLM-friendly internet will be built.

Pulse itself exists to help companies/engineers grow adoption of their MCP-compliant work, and for end-users and collaborators to discover existing solutions.

Our primary, long-term contribution to the community exists in the form of a weekly newsletter, highlighting the ecosystem's major updates, most compelling use cases, and more. Sign up on [our homepage](https://www.pulsemcp.com).

## I just implemented an MCP server. How do I get it to show up on Pulse?

You can either submit it [here](https://www.pulsemcp.com/submit), or just open an [Issue](https://github.com/Transparent-Metrics/pulse-community/issues) in this repository.

If you use the web interface, it will check to make sure we don't already have your submission in our database before you submit.

## Do you catalog MCP clients too?

Yes! Although we're not yet surfacing them on pulsemcp.com, we are collating them behind the scenes and appreciate any submissions [here](https://www.pulsemcp.com/submit).

## What else will Pulse evolve to do?

Stay tuned! As the ecosystem matures, we expect to expand into building useful MCP servers of our own, offering hands-on help with go-to-market strategies for companies and individuals trying to reach an audience with their MCP work, and more.
